/*
Modify the solution to lab 4 so it only counts and totals line items that have an item_price value thatâ€™s greater than 400.
lab4:
Write a SELECT statement that returns one row for each customer that has orders with these columns:
   - The email_address column from the Customers table
   - A count of the number of orders aliased as order_count
   - The total amount for each order aliased as order_total (Hint: First, subtract the discount amount from the price. Then, multiply by the quantity.)

Return only those rows where the customer has more than 1 order.
Sort the result set in descending sequence by the sum of the line item amounts. */
