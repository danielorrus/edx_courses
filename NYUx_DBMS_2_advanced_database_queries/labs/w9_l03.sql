/* Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Orders table:
    - The card_number column
    - The length of the card_number column aliased as card_number_length
    - The last four digits of the card_number column aliased as last_four_digits
    - A column that displays an X for each digit of the card_number column except for the last four digits. If the card number
    contains 16 digits, it should be displayed in this format: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234, where 1234 are the actual last four digits of the number.
    If the card number contains 15 digits, it should be displayed in this format: XXXX-XXXXXX-X1234. (Hint: Use an IF function to determine
    which format to use.).  This column should be aliased as formatted_number

Sort the result set by the card_number column in ascending sequence. */
