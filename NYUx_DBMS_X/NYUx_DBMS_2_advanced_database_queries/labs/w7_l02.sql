/* Write a SELECT statement that returns three columns: email_address, order_id, and the order total for each customer.
To do this, you can group the result set by the email_address and order_id columns. In addition, you must calculate the
order total from the columns in the Order_Items table.

Write a second SELECT statement that uses the first SELECT statement in its FROM clause. The main query should return
three columns: the customerâ€™s email address and the largest order (aliased as max_order_total) and the smallest order_id
(aliased as min_order_id). To do this, you can group the result set by the email_address. Sort the result set by the largest
order in descending sequence. */
