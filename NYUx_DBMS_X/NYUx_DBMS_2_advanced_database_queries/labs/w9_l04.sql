/* Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Orders table:
    - The order_id column
    - The order_date column
    - A column named approx_ship_date that’s calculated by adding 2 days to the order_date column
    - The ship_date column if it doesn’t contain a null value
    - A column named days_to_ship that shows the number of days between the order date and the ship date

add a WHERE clause that retrieves just the orders for March 2018 that have shipped.

Sort the result set by the order_id column in ascending sequence. */
